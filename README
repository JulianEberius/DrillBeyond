DrillBeyond
===========

This repository contains the Postgres-based implementation for the paper "DrillBeyond: Processing Multi-Result Open World SQL Queries".

Compilation
-----------
Install in the same way as regular PostgreSQL.
In addition to any requirements that standard PostgreSQL has, DrillBeyond needs libcurl and libjson-c.
Newer versions of libjson-c may cause problems, manually install version 0.10 from https://github.com/json-c/json-c/releases in this case.


Entity Augmentation Requirements
-------------------------------
As mentioned in the paper, DrillBeyond depends on REA (https://github.com/JulianEberius/REA) for its Entity Augmentation functions. However, it includes a simple stub that can be used to repeat the performance-related experiments (directory "ea_system_stub"). It will return randomly generated data, but it can be configured to return data with a specific selectivity and "fuzziness" (lack of correlation between variants), using the included scripts.

To repeat all experiments in the paper, however, a full installation of REA is necessary.


Evaluation
---------

The experiments in the paper can be repeated using the IPython notebooks (http://ipython.org/notebook.html) in the directory "eval". The notebook "drillbeyond_run_eval" contains the code to run the experiments, the one named "images" the code to generate the images and tables found in the paper.
